## About Me
I am Ricardo, a dedicated Data Scientist and Software Engineer based in Bandung, Indonesia. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Data Science from Universitas Airlangga, where I graduated with a GPA of 3.54/4.0. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as a Data/Software Engineer Intern at the Ministry of Finance Indonesia, where I have developed a parser for law documents using PyMuPDF for OCR, IndoBERT, and regex for information extraction. I also led the development of the JDIH dashboard using Next.js, TypeScript, and OpenSearch Query, enhancing the user interface and functionality. Additionally, I developed a dashboard utilizing the RAG Language Model on Azure, improving data visualization and accessibility.

Previously, I interned at PT Central Artificial Intelligence, where I developed a credit scoring model using Firebase data and ensemble modeling. I also built a Twitter sentiment analyzer using Selenium and the BERT model, and developed RESTful APIs using Flask and Postman. At Kompeten Co, I implemented selenium scripts for data extraction from platforms like edX and Coursera, employing headless browsing and parallel processing techniques to reduce data collection time by 50%.

I have led projects like the detection of fake job advertisements on Instagram using OCR and BERT, where I utilized Docker for model deployment and Optuna for optimizing a Multilingual BERT model. Another significant project was the development of Kaiyaku, a bank churn prediction web app using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, achieving a precision rate of 80%.

My technical skills include programming languages such as Python, SQL (Postgres), JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and R. I am proficient in frameworks like Next.js, React, Node.js, Flask, and FastAPI, and have experience with developer tools including Git, Docker, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), VS Code, Visual Studio, PyCharm, and IntelliJ. I am also skilled in using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

With a strong foundation in data science and software engineering, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and improve data-driven decision-making processes.
